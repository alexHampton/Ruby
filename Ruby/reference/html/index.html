    <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
    <p>This exquisite recipe is almost too easy to be believed!
        Alex wows us with his homemade, lightly toasted, heavily
         buttered toast that you just gotta try.</p>
    <p>We asked Alex just how he came up with the idea for the recipe.
        He said "Well, after years of cooking, I realized that everything 
        tastes better with butter. Think about it. There's buttered steak, 
        buttered potatoes, peanut buttered. I've even been known to put 
        butter on my butter."
